# Pacman in Game Maker

Pacman programmed and designed from scratch in Game Maker using the Game Maker Language.

## About

This project is a continuation of a former project of mine, "Console Pacman". A recreation of the original game by Bandai Namco Entertainment that anyone can look at and mess around with themselves.

## Installation

Installation isn't possible at this time, however, the project can be downloaded and run using Game Maker 2.
